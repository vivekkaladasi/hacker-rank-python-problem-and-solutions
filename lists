Problem
Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e.
append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

Example

N = 4
append 1
append 2
insert 3 1
print

append 1: Append 1 to the list, arr = [1].
append 2: Append 2 to the list, arr = [1, 2].
insert 3 1: Insert 3 at index 1,arr = [1, 3, 2].
print: Print the array.
Output:



#answer
if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input())
    L=[];
    for i in range(0,N):
        cmd=input().split();
        if cmd[0] == "insert":
            L.insert(int(cmd[1]),int(cmd[2]))
        elif cmd[0] == "append":
            L.append(int(cmd[1]))
        elif cmd[0] == "pop":
            L.pop();
        elif cmd[0] == "print":
            print(L)
        elif cmd[0] == "remove":
            L.remove(int(cmd[1]))
        elif cmd[0] == "sort":
            L.sort();
        else:
            L.reverse();
